# Flask Tasks 🧪🚀

This repository is a **collection of small Flask and Python-based tasks/projects** created for **learning, practice, and experimentation** with Flask, backend logic, and basic web utilities.

Instead of being a single large application, this repo contains **multiple independent mini-projects and scripts**, each demonstrating a specific concept or use case.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice **Flask fundamentals**
- Build **mini web utilities**
- Experiment with **Python logic + Flask routing**
- Learn how backend scripts interact with HTML templates
- Improve hands-on backend development skills

This repository is ideal for:
- Beginners learning Flask
- Students practicing backend concepts
- Small demo projects for internships or coursework

---

## 🧩 Contents Overview

The repository includes tasks such as:

- 📝 **Notes Taker**
  - A simple application to take and manage notes.

- 🔗 **URL Shortener**
  - Converts long URLs into shorter versions.

- 🧪 **Regex Matcher**
  - Matches patterns from input strings using regular expressions.

- 🌐 **Name from URL / Query Handling**
  - Extracts and processes data from URL parameters.

- 🎨 **HTML Templates**
  - Frontend templates used with Flask routes.

Each script or folder is mostly **independent**, meaning you can run and test them separately.
